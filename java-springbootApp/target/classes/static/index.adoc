Getting Started With Spring REST Docs of *Campus Collaborate*

All the Rest API end points are available at
http://localhost:8080/api/index

This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register

request
include::{snippets}/authentication-controller-test/test-register-user/http-request.adoc [ ]
response
include::{snippets}/authentication-controller-test/test-register-user/http-response.adoc [ ]



As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
