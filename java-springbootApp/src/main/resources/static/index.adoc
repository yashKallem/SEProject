==== Request

include::{snippets}/authentication-controller-test/test-add-user/http-request.adoc[]

==== Response

include::{snippets}/authentication-controller-test/test-add-user/http-response.adoc[]

==== Test Case: Adding the same user twice

Given a running service at http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register
And a user with the email "example@test.com" has already been added to the database

When a request is made to add a user with the same email "shamsi@wiu.edu" to the database
Then the service should return a 409 Conflict status code
And the response should contain an error message indicating that the user already exists

Example output:
request
include::{snippets}/authentication-controller-test/test-already-added-user/http-request.adoc
response
include::{snippets}/authentication-controller-test/test-already-added-user/http-response.adoc


Explanation:

This test case checks if the service correctly handles the scenario when the same user is being added twice. In this example, we assume that a user with email "shamsi@wiu.edu" has already been added to the database. When a request is made to add another user with the same email, the service should detect the duplicate and return a 409 Conflict status code. The response should contain an error message indicating that the user already exists. This helps to ensure data integrity and prevent duplicate entries in the database.


==== Login

Logs in a user and returns a JWT token.

==== Request

include::{snippets}/authentication-controller-test/test-login-with-correct-password/http-request.adoc[]

==== Response

include::{snippets}/authentication-controller-test/test-login-with-correct-password/http-response.adoc[]


==== Test Case: Invalid credentials
Given a running service at http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/authenticate
To verify that an error message is returned when invalid credentials (email and password) are provided for user authentication.

Test data:
email: shamsi@wiu.edu
password: password123

==== Request

include::{snippets}/authentication-controller-test/test-login-with-wrong-password/http-request.adoc[]

==== Response

include::{snippets}/authentication-controller-test/test-login-with-wrong-password/http-response.adoc[]

Expected result:

The API should return a response with status code 401 (Unauthorized) and an error message indicating that the provided credentials are invalid.
The error message should be well-formatted and should clearly indicate that the email and/or password provided are incorrect.
The response should not contain any sensitive information such as the actual password of the user.
